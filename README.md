# Massive-Parallel Trajectory Calculations

Massive-Parallel Trajectory Calculations (MPTRAC) is a new
Lagrangian particle dispersion model for the free troposphere
and stratosphere. MPTRAC has been developed to support
the analysis of atmospheric transport processes.

This repository contains a specific version of MPTRAC that was used
to study the impact of different numerical integration schemes on
trajectory calculations. The results of the study are published here:

Rößler, T., Stein, O., Heng, Y., and Hoffmann, L.: Regional and
seasonal truncation errors of trajectory calculations using ECMWF
high-resolution operational analyses and forecasts,
Geosci. Model Dev. Discuss., doi:10.5194/gmd-2016-314, in review, 2017.

This version of MPTRAC will not be updated and therefore should not be used
for other research applications. The most recent version of MPTRAC
can be found in this repository:
